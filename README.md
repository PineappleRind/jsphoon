# jsphoon
ASCII Art Phase of the Moon (TypeScript version)
<small><i>(I call it JSPhoon because it's more recognizable)</i></small>

The original version of this was by Jef Poskanzer jef@mail.acme.com (Twitter: @jef_poskanzer) written in Pascal in 1979.

It's been translated by him into C, then by @igor_chubin into Python, and now by me into TypeScript.

I'm basing this one off of the Python version. 

## Usage
I'm aiming for options to be identical to the Python version.

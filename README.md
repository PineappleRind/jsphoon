# jsphoon
ASCII Art Phase of the Moon (TypeScript version)
<small><i>I call it JSPhoon because it's more recognizable</i></small>

The original version of this was by Jef Poskanzer jef@mail.acme.com (Twitter: @jef_poskanzer) written in Pascal in 1979.

It's been translated by him into C, then by @igor_chubin into Python, and now by me into TypeScript.

I'm basing this one off of the Python version. 

## Usage
Ideally identical to the Python version. You'll probably be able to use the same command as pyphoon

So instructions are over here [on pyphoon's readme](https://github.com/chubin/pyphoon/tree/master#usage)

...or you can use the help command
